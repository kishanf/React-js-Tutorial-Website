                    Having not done any web development since first year, I feel like I have gained a lot of valuable skills and uses of new technologies such as bootstrap; I have read up and looked into many frameworks and how they can be used to make a website look aesthetically pleasing. Even though I didn’t not have enough time to finish all the styling as I would have liked I am still extremely pleased at how my site has come out and the responsiveness of it. Learning about more web technologies such as bootstrap, JQuery and how to make responsive web design I feel
                     I have become better at website development in comparison to the website which I made in my first-year web module. I would say that the my use of the web technologies I listed above were a positive for me on this because I was able to grasp the use of them quite quickly and research into more in-depth features about them; the initial design of my website went well at first and this was because I initially planned on creating my sites layout and looked with dummy content then actually adding my content once I was happy with the aesthetic look of it all. 
                     One thing that I would say didn’t go well was when It came to finally filling in my content due to falling ill in the past week and the workload of another deadline two days before this, I was unable to manage my time efficiently to produce the content quality which I wanted. I did not manage to finish all the css as I planned hence some of the text, padding and images of the site are not completely resized or responsive as I had hoped. React.js is one technology which I have gained a lot more knowledge on through the course of this assignment, it is an
                     extremely smart and responsive js library. The architecture goes beyond the browsers as you can briefly see from my tutorial no html is used to for the actual output put in the browsers it is rendered the same as html would be. It also has the ability to allow you to build encapsulated components that are able to manage their own state to the UI. 
                    <br>
                    A self-evaluation of the content produced I would have liked for my tutorial to be a lot more detailed and have delve further into React.js and how it used JSX. Having learned a great deal more throughout the course of this assignment I feel that I am apple to apply some of towards my final year project; gaining alot of knowledge on not just react.js but the react script as a whole, I am now extremly interested in React.Native and I plan on looking further into it and how I can implement it into my final year project as i feel it is valuable to know and use.
                     I have included a list of reference from various sites which I used to read up and learn more from.
