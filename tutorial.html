                <strong> This tutorial is to show you howo to set up a successful enviroment to develop react in. This tutorial is
                    meant to be a little introduction into the concepts of react.js and how it is different from html and
                    css in the sense that it uses virtual DOM which improves app peformance this is due to virtual DOM being
                    alot faster and responsive than the regualar standard of DOM.

                <h2>React.js Development Enviroment Setup </h2>
                <h4>There are many steps involed in this first part I will be showing you the installation of packages and plugins
                    through the command prompt</h4>
                <p> First we have to create the root folder, this is where all applicaton files will be stored. We will place
                    it on our desktop so it is easy to locate and route to. Open up your CMD or Terminal depending on which
                    OS you're running and enter the command below, i'm using OSX i'll be running all of this in Terminal
                    which will look different but the paths and directories are the same. For those of you who use windows
                    you would enter -
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\mkdir reactdemo</strong> Check your desktop as you should now have a folder called
                    reactdemo; now we will create an empty json package enter
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\reactdemo >npm init</strong>, now you will be prompted with a list of instructions
                    for installing packages.
                </p>
                <img src="images/1.png" class="image2" alt="">
                <p>Now we are going to be installing several Babel packages and plugins some local and some global. start by
                    entering
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\reactdemo >npm install -g babel</strong> and
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\reactdemo >npm install -g babel-cli</strong>. Babel is a transpiler for JS, it
                    is known for being able to turn ES6 into code that is able to run in browsers and servers, So it is extremly
                    useful when creating web applications.
                </p>
                <img src="images/22.png" class="image2">
                <p>Next we are going to be installing webpack which is javascript module bundler, it puts all your assests into
                    a dependency graph. enter the following
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\reactdemo >npm install webpack --save</strong> and
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\reactdemo >npm install webpack-dev-server-save</strong>. Now we are going to
                    install React while still using the command promt, enter the following
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\reactdemo >npm install react --save</strong> and
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\reactdemo >npm install react-dom --save</strong>. There are now 4 babel plugins
                    which you are to install I will list the first one then install the rest via the use of the picture included
                    below;
                    <strong>\Users\username\Desktop\reactdemo >npm babel-core</strong>.

                        there will be one HTML file, one JSX file, one JS file and one webpack file to help consolidate everything.

                <p>
                    <strong> You're now going to want to open up the package.json and delete the "TEST: echo" line and replace it
                        with webpack-dev-server --hot". we are deleting this since we have no use for testing the classes
                        right now.<br> 
                        We are using webpack because it is a module bundler which helps to split the application into multiple file; this helps 
                    by splitting our code into chunks and loading them on demand. Loading them on demand is useful in the sense that it helps us in reducing the loading
                time of our application. webpack is an extremely helpful tool to have becasue once you specify a single path it does the rest 
            of the work by going through you application and working out how everything is connected throught the values in your css; this 
            tends to be very helpful in regards to single page applications which are becoming the most popular type of web applications.

                                WORLD! or whichever output you would like.JSX is the lanuages which react.js uses. Copy the
                                code from the next picture and put that into your main.js file this is importing all of the

                                As I mentioned before JSX is the lanuage which React uses, it is a statically typed OOP language
                                designed to run on current web browsers. JSX is is faster this is due to the face that it optimises while
                                compiling all of the source code; this results in the compiled code running faster than similar code written
                                via the use of JavaScript. Offering a solid class system similar to Java it allows developers to get away from 
                                the inheritence system supplied by JavaScript.
